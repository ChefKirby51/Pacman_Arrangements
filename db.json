                Blinky comes out after Pac-man has eaten a specific amount of pellets and chases Pac-man\
                based on where Blinky's trajectory is. Where Blinky is, Inky is soon to follow,\
                which can lead to Pac-man being trapped between two ghosts. Luckily, Inky himself never chases Pac-man\
                himself, so as long as you know that, Inky can be easily avoided."

                Clyde will essentially scurry away to a set location. Don't underestimate Clyde, though, he can still kill\
                Pac-man and, because of his unpredictability, don't be surprised to bump into Clyde when you\

                a hinderince, having the unique ability to fuse with Blinky, Pinky, Inky and/or Clyde,\
                resulting in changing the Ghost gang into stronger opponents. Rather than chasing Pac-man, Kinky\
                chases the Ghosts, and, when acheiving contact, does the aforementioned fusing.\
                The longer Pac-man stays in a level and the farther the game progresses, Kinky will\
                fuse with more ghosts and at a faster pace.\
                The upside to this is that Kinky is (Until world 4), permanently in a vulnerable state of which\
                Pac-man can and SHOULD eat, as that Kinky doubles as a Power-pellet.\
                If you run out of power-pellets, if Kinky is around, he can really help out."

		  Blinky has a charge move that sends him flying toward Pac-man at a horizontal position. While this sounds \
		  like a big problem, Blinky's horizontal criteria and big start up animation leaves his charge very easy to \

		  But don't let her new looks fool you, she's still out for pac blood and has a new ability in the \
		  form of a jump that will send Pinky to Pac-man's current location. New players beware, as Pinky's \
		  jump is quick and will have you breathing over you in now time. But for the more seasoned players, \
		  Powered Pinky's ability is quite easy to avoid, as her move is telegraphed with a symbol of where \
		  she's land, and her landing animation takes time."

		  position, essentially creating a 6th ghost! The saving grace is that the mirror only lasts \
		  a couple seconds, and can be interrupted with power-pellets and the Pink pill. Powered Inky \
		  is a menace, especially if Kinky choses to chase him first, so be sure to keep your \
		  power-pellets close by."

		  occasionally spitting out pellets in rows. This is a big problem, as the longer you're in \
		  in a level, the more dangerous the level gets. You may think that you have all the \
		  pellets eaten, but Clyde has other plans, scattering new pellets in places you have \
		  struggle to get to. If Kinky is in a bad mood and transforms Clyde first, good luck..."
